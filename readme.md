## Description

## Software Used
* React (with React Hooks!)
* Styled Components for styling
* Node.js and UDP4 sockets for communicating with drone
* Socket.io WebSockets for sending data to/from the browser
* Next.js for easy react setup

## Hardware Used
* [DJI Tello Drone](https://amzn.to/2SvzqON)
* [Extra Batteries](https://amzn.to/2SyV70J) - it comes with one and I bought two extra. For continual development I'd say you only need two â€” one in the charger and one in the drone. For flying away from your house you definitely need at least 3 as they only last about 10-15 mins.
* [Fast Battery Charger with 4 slots](https://amzn.to/2SAWqwb)
